## [Live preview](https://homeworkmon.github.io/Weather-App/)

[Odin Project's Weather App Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app) - goal was to connect to Open Weather API and display data 

### What I learned: 

1. How to access, read and display data from APIs in JSON format!
2. Javascript Promises and async/await + try/catch function syntax
3. Played around with installing prettier and eslint and formatting in VSCode
